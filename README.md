# RTB2002s

Windows communication application for Rohde & Schwarz RTB2002 Oscilloscope to fetch data of pulse discharge plasma I-V.
- Pulse discharge is generated by a custom built pulse power source. It recieves the TTL timing signal and output the voltage set by a potentiostat manually.
- The power source equips the voltage monitor output 1:1000.
- The discharge current is monitored by a 0.01V/A current monitor.
- RTB2002 recieves the voltage signal to CH1, the current signal to CH2, and the trigger signal from the function generator to Ext Trig input.
- The math functions are used as follows:
  - Math1: The current signal baseline is obtained before discharge and subtracted from the CH2 signal during the measurement
  - Math2: The CH1 voltage signal and Math1 are multiplied to obtain the instanteneous discharge power
  - Math3: Math2 is integrated to obtain the energy of the single pulse shot.
  - Math4: Math3 is multiplied by the pulse frequency (manually input) to obtain the average power
 - This application shows the Math4 data to the window screen to adjust the average power by controlling the discharge voltage potentiostat.
 - It also helps the Voltage and Current waveforms from RTB2002 and save them to CSV files.
